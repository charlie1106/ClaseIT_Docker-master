        The implementation of the SOLID principles in a work environment
        Carlos Alejandro Jiménez Laguna
        Introduction
        With the arrival of Industry 4.0 as well as the arrival of the pandemic by COVID-19, the technological world, 
        as well as the fourth industrial revolution were driven into the innovation sector for the development of digital
        content in different fields of action such as AI (Artificial Intelligence), nanotechnology, robotics,
        IOT (Internet of Things), among others. The digital revolution that advances by leaps and bounds day by day 
        does not leave behind that there is always a software development behind, but ¿Do we know how to program?,
        many developers focus on delivering a product that meets the necessary functions requested by a customer, 
        however, when creating software not only must comply with the required functions, but also must be quality 
        content.
        The development of applications at a global level for micro, medium and macro companies is leaving developers 
        in a bad position when delivering software, currently the most used programming methodologies are agile
        methodologies, which consist of presenting small portions of code as micro deliveries to increase flexibility 
        and openness to change in case of adjustments that the customer may suggest, which for any company is a great 
        advantage to make changes during the march, but behind the promise of implementing changes during the process 
        there is a very big risk and is the fact that time is running and each delivery suggests adjustments from the 
        customer plus what is planned for the next delivery, so the work can become overwhelming by pushing for quick 
        results, this implies that many developers in the eagerness to deliver fast results fail to comply with basic 
        programming principles such as SOLID.
        Argumentation
        With the above we can open a door to the neglect of the quality of work thanks to the implementation of agile 
        methodologies that can be a great advantage for companies but a disadvantage for the quality of the product, 
        in order to counteract this negative effect on the work done by developers, it is important that the support 
        between employees and developers, according to the national government of Colombia in conjunction with the 
        Administrative Department of Public Function the physical work environment plays a crucial role in the development
        of a healthy and efficient work environment. With slight changes made to the physical work environment a worker 
        can feel confident in how to work in terms of schedules to manage their personal and workspaces, along with social
        complicity, where an open and enlightened environment clears the mind allowing creativity to unfold in all workers.
        For an environment of developers whereas a result of pandemic remote jobs increased substantially where for 
        example according to the MinTIC, Colombia exceeded 209.000 teleworkers by 2020 which shows that teleworking 
        is a tool that although it existed previously did not have the strength it has today, still, many of these 
        workers did not feel comfortable mixing their work life with their personal life which according to the
        Pan-American Health Organization thanks to the mixture of these two factors and other more the anxiety rose 
        by 25%, The effectiveness of the implementation of a physical work environment where they feel comfortable 
        was lost, because, a comfortable work environment does not refer to a home work environment, an office is 
        specially designed for a work environment for the welfare of the worker. Focusing a little more on our specific
        problem, we realize that developers should increase their social relationships in work environments in person, 
        not only remotely, but the comfort of home can also be a major disadvantage that opens the door to 
        procrastination work, a factor that directly influences the loss of quality of work.
        The improvement of the development of a product arises if many of the main components are aligned and in tune
        for a suitable environment as previously mentioned, having said this we can cover the SOLID principles which 
        are those that provide direct quality to the development product, the acronym SOLID refers to five important 
        aspects for software quality, which are: single responsibility principle, open/closed principle, Liskov
        substitution principle, interface segregation principle and finally the principle of dependency inversion. 
        These principles are a fundamental basis for the development of an application, thought, development experts 
        criticize these principles as ambiguous, confusing, complicate the code and even complicating software 
        development, as stated by James D. McCaffrey, (Software Engineer). It is important to emphasize that just
        as there are criticisms and pros of SOLID, the most important thing is to recognize that these principles
        are not a structured guide of steps or a law that must be fulfilled by one hundred percent, on the contrary,
        these principles seek to guide the developer to increase the effectiveness of code in such a way that
        generates what many call clean code, however, as in life not everything is possible and nothing is perfect, 
        there will always be errors in programming and software structure, It is not necessary to verify 
        that every part of our code complies with the principles, because most likely it will never be achieved, 
        or it will take much longer than expected, instead it is possible to maintain a margin of percentages, 
        where 70% or 80% of the code complies with these principles is a high standard of reliability without 
        having to bind or complicate the code as James states.
        Conclusions
        The importance of the SOLID principles goes beyond just keeping a clean code, it is to maintain high software
        quality standards ensuring that the efficiency of this is the best possible, however, it is not always 
        possible and that should not be a setback, in any case, you should always strive to keep these principles
        present when developing taking into account that they are not a law, they are only a guide for development.
        The rootedness to the new work environments leaves us in a situation of disconnection from the face-to-face
        work world, leaving aside the face-to-face relationships with our coworkers, which as we have seen are essential
        for the development to be much more efficient in all types of work environments.
        In order to maintain a high-quality standard in our software we must know that the SOLID principles are not a 
        law that must be followed if or if, there may be situations where it is not fulfilled without becoming critical
        for the code, as well as maintaining support among colleagues to increase work production with less stress and 
        leaving aside procrastination. With these two premises we can affirm that an agile methodology does not sound 
        so bad, the health of a worker will be at perfect state if a healthy work environment is maintained hand in hand 
        with the knowledge that perfection does not exist.

        Why is it important for organizations to have the availability of resources such as computing and services on 
        the Internet?
        Organizations today are immersed in the fourth largest industrial stage in history, this stage is known 
        as Industry 4.0 or fourth industrial revolution that focuses on interconnectivity, automation, machine 
        learning and real-time data. This stage has set a very highly competitive standard for companies in any 
        sector, since it is not only about investing in technology and tools to improve efficiency, but it is about 
        revolutionizing the way an organization operates or scales, so it requires the implementation of advanced 
        production technologies and the operation with intelligent technologies that are integrated with human beings, 
        organizations and their assets.
        Industry 4.0, also known as IoT or smart manufacturing, integrates with intelligent digital technology, 
        automated learning and big data to create a more holistic and better-connected ecosystem for companies. 
        While every company and organization operating today is different, they all face the same challenge, which
        is the need for connectivity and access to real-time information on all processes, partners, products and 
        people. That is why some of them have cloud storage; infrastructure and services from the Internet and 
        finally with AI (Artificial Intelligence) or programmed machinery from its base, to operate automatically 
        and controlled. It should be noted that their implementation requires a high cost of investment, training 
        and adaptation, in order to be an updated and competent industry.
        In terms of infrastructure and services, cloud computing is responsible for keeping computing resources and
        various software and hardware services available through the Internet in a standard way or adjusted to the 
        needs of a company. This technology avoids organizations having to take care of provisioning, configuring, 
        or managing resources and allows payment only for what is used. Cloud computing is the execution of workloads
        in clouds, which are IT environments that pull, pool and share flexible resources from a network. This 
        technology can be seen and understood as an environment because it is the sites where applications run, 
        an element because it is a software and hardware system that is used to design and use clouds, and finally
        as an action because it executes a certain workload in the cloud.
        For what concerns the adaptation of machinery and resources with AI we find that what concerns the resources; 
        if an organization has cloud computing of itself already works with AI in its network because the handling of 
        Big Data, analysis, manipulation and storage is done automatically and customized that even scale, all from 
        the Internet, there is no need for external handling or manipulation there, such process is done only once 
        when configuring and agreeing with the organization that needs required in the cloud and how they are going
        to be supplied. With respect to the machinery, today they all have a screen that is connected to the Internet 
        and has a basic programming functionality, so it can be updated at lower cost and adapt the AI, since it 
        has a connection to the network and only one element must be incurred.
        In effect, we see that there is a need for hardware and software connection, for the proper functioning 
        of any technology belonging to this fourth industrial revolution. If we have a highly functional software,
        adapted and in the cloud, but old machinery and manipulated only with buttons, no optimization in the 
        processes or an improvement in production will arise, because of its high human manipulation. In turn, 
        if we have the latest technology machinery, but there is no infrastructure or services organized and 
        structured in one place, we incur a loss of information, there can be no real-time monitoring and physical 
        investment without logic would be useless.
        Finally, we can make a parallel of the requirements and needs that arise with the constant technological 
        growth, both at the hardware level with machinery, servers and electronic elements with Internet connection
        and programmed, and at the software level not with local bases but already scaled to a cloud network that 
        requires an infrastructure and a service provider. Thus, highlighting that organizations today without an 
        update and a network connection in the cloud that keeps interconnected its logical level with the physical 
        are inefficient and obsolete, and for a customer will not have the ability to meet their needs for their 
        production delays and under analysis.
